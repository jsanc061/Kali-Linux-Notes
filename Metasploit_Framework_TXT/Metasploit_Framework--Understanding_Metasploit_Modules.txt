UNDERSTANDING METASPLOIT MODULES

Modules usually saved in the following directory:

    cd /usr/share/metasploit-framework/modules

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Exploits - A module that will take advantage of a system's vulnerability and it will install/plant a payload onto the victim machine

Payloads - Files left onto the victim machine that gives you access or control over the system
              - Ex: Rootkits / reverse shell
              
              - Divided into 3 groups:
                    1. Singles    -    ( Designed to do one single action )
                                            Ex: Keylogging
                    2. Stagers   -    ( Used for creating a communication link between the attacker and the victim machine )
                                      -     ( Can be used to deliver another payload ) 
                    3. Stages    -     ( Very large payloads, can give very good control over the target )
                                            Ex: VNC connections, meterpreter shell, reverse shell

Auxiliary - Unique types of modules that perform scanning, fuzzing, sniffing, etc. to find vulnerabilities about the target

Encoders - Used to re-encode payloads and exploits to get by security systems such as anti-viruses

Nops (No Operation) - Causes the system's CPU to do nothing for 1 clock cycle which can allow you to remotely execute a specific file/code after you've exploited the buffer overflow

Post - Used after the target system has been exploited, allows you to perform further attacks once the system has been owned
        Ex: Keyloggers, webcam, browser information
